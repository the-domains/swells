Met up with Magnus and the **[CROSSWATER][0]** guys this weekend to get the latest from their quest towards the "prefect stroke". 
Their long research has led them to something they call "the Nordic stroke". The approach is very scientific and I have a lot to learn if I want to paddle faster and more efficient. The most dramatic change however, is that I'm now using my (already very short) wave paddle together with the race board...
Looks fast, doesn't it?
